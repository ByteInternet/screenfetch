Description: Bash Screenshot Information Tool
 screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash script
 can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII
 distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays.
 .
 It will auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII version of that 
 distribution's logo and some valuable information to the right. There are 
 options to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a screenshot upon displaying
 info, and even customizing the screenshot command.
